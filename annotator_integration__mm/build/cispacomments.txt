From my reading, it explicitly includes intellectual property as a cybersecurity issue unto itself. (I have no idea why this would be justified.)

  That's not what I see when I read it. It doesn't state that intellectual property as a cybersecurity issue unto itself, only "protection of a system or network" from theft or misappropriation of that property. The bill does not expand an entity's power to control the distribution of that property after its theft/misappropriation from its network.

    Your reading is correct. This bill is about cyber security and not copyright protection. ISPs are actually a minor part of this bill -- it's aimed to protect critical infrastructure. ISPs would only be sharing data that involves there role as critical US infrastructure, and so monitoring individual users isn't the point at all. If the wording needs cleaned up, that's one thing, but the intent is clearly not to spy on citizens.

      I would not argue against your guys' reading. In fact, although I personally read it differently, I would rather go with your reading. However, the very fact that it can be read the way the OP and I read it means that it is too ambiguous.

      Yes, the bill is about cyber security. And yes, the bill is clearly designed to facilitate the foiling of and the apprehension of those who would hack into networks or systems to do malicious things. And yes, the bill does not create new crimes of any sort.

      However, it allows for novel forms of collection and aggregation of personal data. This data can then be used for myriad purposes, all in the guise of "cyber security," such as "theft" of intellectual property. Copyright infringement, patent infringement, and piracy of any sort are sometimes equated to theft, and although perhaps in most places at the current time it is not, that could easily become a widespread interpretation of this clause. Besides, if any company or government organization is caught misinterpreting it, they are safe anyway. Once they have evidence of someone "stealing" their IP, they have plenty of opportunity to persecute them through existing statutes.

      I believe that there should be a law passed to stop hackers from taking down websites, stealing personal information, blowing up power plants, etc.
      %br
      This isn't it.
      %br
      Nor is any law that attempts to protect IP. IP should be protected in its own laws, using its own rules. Preferably several laws dealing with different forms of IP.

So, whenever I transmit information through my ISP to which I hold the copyright, the ISP is authorized by this bill copy my information and distribute it to third parties without my knowledge or consent, in flagrant violation of my copyright? Because anything copyrighted by anyone is considered intellectual property? That's some bullshit right there.

  That is not a settled issue. If you post your video on some sites (and I think reddit is one of them - to be honest I didn't read the TOS either), the TOS says you just gave them the copyright.
  %br  
  How does that work for information only being transmitted by your ISP? I don't know, and nobody else really knows either. The laws on all this are still developing.
  %br
  And keep in mind that most legislators aren't 20 or 25 years old - they have no idea how the internet works. Which means most of the legislation is either being written by relative idiots or - more likely - by their 'knowledgeable advisors'. That would be lobbyists.

    You're just flat out wrong on the first point. You just don't "give them the copyright", you are effectively offering a very wishy-washy license for the limited purpose of that post. It gets more complicated for professional sites looking to broadcast to a wide audience. Look at the fine print at the bottom of Tosh.0's submission page for that. When you post to YouTube or link to something here, it's a license to rebroadcast and an affirmation you own the content. To sign over the copyright has tax implications actually (it'd make it a "work for hire" and reddit could owe you some important benefits).
    %br
    As for what is transmitted by your ISP? That's just IP logs, mainly. And record data, such as your subscriber info. If ANY content is observed as it goes through the intarweb pipes, it's effectively a wiretap, and prohibited. The real unsettled question is whether Deep Packet Inspection that looks beyond the header data amounts to a wiretap or not (I believe it does, but I don't have any say in the matter).

      IANAL - so take it for what it's worth. This is where my opinion came from, but you may know more about it than this guy does.
      %br
      And "transmitted by" = "transmitted via", i.e. what I am transmitting right now. And I am pretty sure that what the NSA has been doing is "wiretapping" in the sense that they are tapping the wires, but not "wiretapping" in the sense that - as you say - 'it's prohibited'. When the government does something, it's not illegal. This is why. Google FISAAA.

      Do you really not know this? I am an old geezer so I have been following this stuff for years, go here for a 2 minute preview of what the story was all about.

        The difference lies in your sentence that "when the gov't does something, it's not illegal".
        %br
        That's 100% true, and the NSA is the gov't. And while I don't defend that practice, I do say that at the very absolute least there is some judicial oversight of that process. When the MAFIAA gets to do it, there's no judicial oversight. That is a huge problem. They are not the gov't, and even with a gov't fiat like in this bill, I don't see it going nicely with the provisions in Title III/ECPA and various state analogs that explicitly state that only a government investigative body may subpoena/issue warrants for records/content information, and the ISPs may only monitor traffic for their own diagnostic needs and are forbidden from disclosing said information to third parties unless lawful legal process is provided.
        %br
        The MAFIAA is not a gov't investigative body. They don't have the power to issue a warrant or a wiretap or even a subpoena in the same way that a gov't agency does.
        %br
        As for forum posts, the actual bits belong to the server owner. They are who receive the court summons. However, they cannot claim lawful title to the intellectual property rights associated with it. They can, however, put a defacto license that we all accept by posting, which allows them to republish and whatnot. But they can't claim authorship. Copyright vests in YOU the moment YOU fix your original idea in a tangible medium of expression, unless you agree to a work-for-hire arrangement.
