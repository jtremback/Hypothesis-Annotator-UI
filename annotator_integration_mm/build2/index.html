                      That's not what I see when I read it. It doesn't state that intellectual property as a cybersecurity issue unto itself, only "protection of a system or network" from theft or misappropriation of that property. The bill does not expand an entity's power to control the distribution of that property after its theft/misappropriation from its network.

                          Your reading is correct. This bill is about cyber security and not copyright protection. ISPs are actually a minor part of this bill it's aimed to protect critical infrastructure. ISPs would only be sharing data that involves there role as critical US infrastructure, and so monitoring individual users isn't the point at all. If the wording needs cleaned up, that's one thing, but the intent is clearly not to spy on citizens.

                              I would not argue against your guys' reading. In fact, although I personally read it differently, I would rather go with your reading. However, the very fact that it can be read the way the OP and I read it means that it is too ambiguous.

                              Yes, the bill is about cyber security. And yes, the bill is clearly designed to facilitate the foiling of and the apprehension of those who would hack into networks or systems to do malicious things. And yes, the bill does not create new crimes of any sort.
                            </p>

                              However, it allows for novel forms of collection and aggregation of personal data. This data can then be used for myriad purposes, all in the guise of "cyber security," such as "theft" of intellectual property. Copyright infringement, patent infringement, and piracy of any sort are sometimes equated to theft, and although perhaps in most places at the current time it is not, that could easily become a widespread interpretation of this clause. Besides, if any company or government organization is caught misinterpreting it, they are safe anyway. Once they have evidence of someone "stealing" their IP, they have plenty of opportunity to persecute them through existing statutes.

                            <p>
                              I believe that there should be a law passed to stop hackers from taking down websites, stealing personal information, blowing up power plants, etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              This isn't it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Nor is any law that attempts to protect IP. IP should be protected in its own laws, using its own rules. Preferably several laws dealing with different forms of IP.
