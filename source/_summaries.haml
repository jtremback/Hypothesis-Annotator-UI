      %p From my reading, it explicitly includes intellectual property as a cybersecurity issue unto itself. (I have no idea why this would be justified.)

      %p The bill's authors could take this provision out and companies will still get all the benefits they wanted in the first place. This spying section is the portion that will destroy our privacy and it's a section that's not even needed to accomplish the bill's goals.
      %p Facebook even admitted on Friday they don't like this section, don't need it, or don't want it, but for now, it's still in the bill. So that's why we need people to go here and email their member of Congress to vote against it.

      %p I am fearful that the current reactive approach to these bills will fail. They keep coming and coming and the ability to mobilize people time after time decreases. Eventually, the lobbying groups will slip these pieces of legislation through one small piece at a time. It's an effective tactic. It is my opinion that we need take a proactive stance to preempt these actions. My question to you, EFF, is what are our options, legislatively or other wise, to pass/ensure some basic protections for the architecture of a free and open Internet to discourage the seemingly unending onslaught to these harmful pieces of legislation?
      %p Instead of trying to educate, organize, and mobilize citizens 10,20, or 50 times, why can't we nail down some sort of basic internet bill of rights and mobilize everybody once to support it? The impact of that would be magnitudes greater.

      %p I say focus on two lines, the main description where it says "for other purpose" i mean WTF? and then later when it says people are clear of liability if they have good intentions. Lets get people to read the bill, these are ludicrous lines in a fairly moderate bill. The line stating that any requests authorized by this bill must be reported in non-classified form is AWESOME and helps us a lot.
