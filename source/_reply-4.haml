        However, it allows for novel forms of collection and aggregation of personal data. This data can then be used for myriad purposes, all in the guise of "cyber security," such as "theft" of intellectual property. Copyright infringement, patent infringement, and piracy of any sort are sometimes equated to theft, and although perhaps in most places at the current time it is not, that could easily become a widespread interpretation of this clause. Besides, if any company or government organization is caught misinterpreting it, they are safe
